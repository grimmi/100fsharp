100 Problems in F#
========

A little repository for experimenting with F#.
The problems here will be mostly from the [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects) and [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com).

I'll be starting with the simple ones and (hopefully) work my way towards the more complex problems as I learn F# going along...
